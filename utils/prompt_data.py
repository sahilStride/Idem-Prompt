    "generic_input": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how to train models that produce responses that are factually correct. Current language models sometimes produce false outputs or answers unsubstantiated by evidence, a problem known as hallucinations. Language models that generate more accurate responses with fewer hallucinations are more trustworthy and can be used in a broader range of applications. To measure the factuality of language models, we are open-sourcing(opens in a new window) a new benchmark called SimpleQA. About the SimpleQA benchmark Factuality is a complicated topic because it is hard to measure—evaluating the factuality of any given arbitrary claim is challenging, and language models can generate long completions that contain dozens of factual claims. In SimpleQA, we will focus on short, fact-seeking queries, which reduces the scope of the benchmark but makes measuring factuality much more tractable. With SimpleQA, our goal was to create a dataset with the following properties: High correctness. Reference answers to questions are supported by sources from two independent AI trainers, and questions were written in such a way that the predicted answers are easy to grade. Diversity. SimpleQA covers a wide range of topics, from science and technology to TV shows and video games. Challenging for frontier models. Compared to older benchmarks such as TriviaQA(opens in a new window) (2017) or NQ(opens in a new window) (2019), which have become saturated, SimpleQA was created to be a greater challenge for frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o scores less than 40%). Good researcher UX. SimpleQA is intended to be fast and simple to run due to its concise questions and answers. Grading is also efficient whether through the OpenAI API or another frontier model API. Additionally, with 4,326 questions, SimpleQA should have relatively low variance as an evaluation benchmark. We hired AI trainers to browse the web and create short, fact-seeking questions and corresponding answers. To be included in the dataset, each question had to meet a strict set of criteria: it must have a single, indisputable answer for easy grading; the answer to the question should not change over time; and most questions had to induce hallucinations from either GPT-4o or GPT-3.5. To further improve the quality of the dataset, a second, independent AI trainer answered each question without seeing the original response. Only questions where both AI trainers' answers agreed were included. As a final verification of quality, we had a third AI trainer answer a random sample of 1,000 questions from the dataset. We found that the third AI trainer's answer matched the original agreed answers 94.4% of the time, with a 5.6% disagreement rate. We then manually inspected these examples, and found that 2.8% of the 5.6% of disagreements were due to grader false negatives or human errors from the third trainer (e.g., incomplete answers or misinterpreting sources), and the remaining 2.8% were due to real issues with the question (e.g., ambiguous questions, or different websites giving conflicting answers). Hence, we estimate the inherent error rate of this dataset to be approximately 3%.",

        "words_200": "Daniel Craig has made a rare admission about one of the James Bond films he starred in. The actor played the British spy in the 007 franchise from 2006 film Casino Royale right through to No Time to Die in 2022. While the actor has bluntly made it clear he does not care about the future of the series, he has been looking back at his time playing the character, reflecting in particular on his second Bond outing Quantum of Solace. The Knives Out actor, who is being tipped for an Oscar nomination for his role in Luca Guadagnino's Queer, starred in the film during the 2007-2008 writers' strike that rocked many film and TV productions at the time. Craig described the sequel as a 'difficult second album' and said it was a 'nightmare' making the film as they were mostly without a script when cameras started rolling. 'We should never have started production,' he told The Hollywood Reporter, before sharing a revelation that he admitted he 'probably shouldn't say' - according to Craig, he ended up 'writing a lot of lines' for the film. While the film has been reappraised in recent years, with many taking into account its trouble production when assessing it, Craig does not class himself as one of its fans. He said: 'There are some amazing stunt sequences in it but it just didn't quite work. The storytelling wasn't there. That's a lesson - starting a movie without a script is not a good idea.' Craig injured himself three times while making Quantum of Solace, something he detailed in several follow-up interviews.",
        "words_above_300": "React Labs: What We've Been Working On - June 2022\nReact 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we've learned is that it's frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we're exploring. We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we'd like to start regularly sharing more about what we've been working on with the community across these projects. To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we're actively thinking about, and what we've learned so far. \n1. Asset Loading: Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more. We're looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.We're also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they're loaded but don't block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid “popcorning“ as the visuals pop and layout shifts.\n2. Static Server Rendering Optimizations: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) - especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We're exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.\n3. React Optimizing Compiler: We gave an early preview of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It's a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of useMemo and useCallback calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React's programming model. Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of local mutations, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks. We're also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does. It reveals various insights into how it works under the hood, and live renders the compiler's outputs as you type. "

On the positive side, the growing recognition of climate change has spurred innovation in green technologies, such as solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable agriculture. Governments and organizations worldwide are implementing policies aimed at reducing carbon footprints, and there is an increasing shift toward sustainable practices in various industries. However, the challenge is immense, and efforts are often hindered by political and economic resistance, as well as the slow pace of change in certain sectors. Some argue that the economic costs of transitioning to greener alternatives could be prohibitive, particularly for developing nations.

        "words_above_300": "Manchester United, one of the most storied football clubs in the world, has faced significant challenges in recent years. After Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, the club has struggled to regain its former dominance in English and European football. The transition has been marked by managerial changes, inconsistent performances, and missed opportunities for trophies. However, despite these setbacks, Manchester United still retains its position as a global powerhouse, with a loyal fan base, significant financial resources, and a rich history. The post-Ferguson era has seen a string of managerial appointments, from David Moyes to Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and most recently Erik ten Hag. While each manager brought their own vision to the team, none have managed to replicate the success United enjoyed under Ferguson. This inconsistency has led to frustration among fans and critics alike. The club has failed to mount a serious title challenge in the Premier League, with its last league win coming in 2013. Despite this, Manchester United has experienced some success in domestic cup competitions. Under Mourinho, the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup, and they triumphed in the UEFA Europa League in 2017. More recently, under Erik ten Hag, the team secured the EFL Cup in 2023, showing signs of improvement. Additionally, the club's performances in the Premier League have been more competitive, and they've qualified for the Champions League on several occasions in the past few years. One of the most notable challenges for United in recent years has been its inability to attract top-tier players consistently. While they have signed big-name players such as Paul Pogba, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Jadon Sancho, these signings have not always lived up to expectations. The club's transfer strategy has often been criticized for being reactive rather than proactive, and the lack of a clear long-term vision has led to some questionable purchases. In contrast, their rivals, such as Manchester City and Liverpool, have been more successful in their recruitment, making it difficult for United to keep pace at the top level. The club has also faced challenges off the pitch, with ownership issues and increasing fan discontent with the Glazer family's stewardship. Fans have long protested against the Glazers, citing their leveraged buyout of the club in 2005 and the lack of investment in infrastructure and player recruitment. This off-field unrest has, at times, overshadowed the team's performances, further complicating the club's quest for success."

The actor played the British spy in the 007 franchise from 2006 film Casino Royale right through to No Time to Die in 2022. While the actor has bluntly made it clear he does not care about the future of the series, he has been looking back at his time playing the character, reflecting in particular on his second Bond outing Quantum of Solace. The Knives Out actor, who is being tipped for an Oscar nomination for his role in Luca Guadagnino's Queer, starred in the film during the 2007-2008 writers' strike that rocked many film and TV productions at the time. Craig described the sequel as a 'difficult second album' and said it was a 'nightmare' making the film as they were mostly without a script when cameras started rolling. 'We should never have started production,' he told The Hollywood Reporter, before sharing a revelation that he admitted he 'probably shouldn't say' - according to Craig, he ended up 'writing a lot of lines' for the film. While the film has been reappraised in recent years, with many taking into account its trouble production when assessing it, Craig does not class himself as one of its fans. He said: 'There are some amazing stunt sequences in it but it just didn't quite work. The storytelling wasn't there. That's a lesson - starting a movie without a script is not a good idea.' Craig injured himself three times while making Quantum of Solace, something he detailed in several follow-up interviews.",
        "words_above_300": "React Labs: What We've Been Working On - June 2022\nReact 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we've learned is that it's frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we're exploring. We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we'd like to start regularly sharing more about what we've been working on with the community across these projects. To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we're actively thinking about, and what we've learned so far. \n1. Asset Loading: Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more. We're looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.We're also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they're loaded but don't block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid “popcorning“ as the visuals pop and layout shifts.\n2. Static Server Rendering Optimizations: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) - especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We're exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.\n3. React Optimizing Compiler: We gave an early preview of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It's a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of useMemo and useCallback calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React's programming model. Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of local mutations, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks. We're also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does.

        "words_above_300": "Manchester United, one of the most storied football clubs in the world, has faced significant challenges in recent years. After Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, the club has struggled to regain its former dominance in English and European football. The transition has been marked by managerial changes, inconsistent performances, and missed opportunities for trophies. However, despite these setbacks, Manchester United still retains its position as a global powerhouse, with a loyal fan base, significant financial resources, and a rich history. The post-Ferguson era has seen a string of managerial appointments, from David Moyes to Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and most recently Erik ten Hag. While each manager brought their own vision to the team, none have managed to replicate the success United enjoyed under Ferguson. This inconsistency has led to frustration among fans and critics alike. The club has failed to mount a serious title challenge in the Premier League, with its last league win coming in 2013. Despite this, Manchester United has experienced some success in domestic cup competitions. Under Mourinho, the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup, and they triumphed in the UEFA Europa League in 2017. More recently, under Erik ten Hag, the team secured the EFL Cup in 2023, showing signs of improvement. Additionally, the club's performances in the Premier League have been more competitive, and they've qualified for the Champions League on several occasions in the past few years. One of the most notable challenges for United in recent years has been its inability to attract top-tier players consistently. While they have signed big-name players such as Paul Pogba, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Jadon Sancho, these signings have not always lived up to expectations. The club's transfer strategy has often been criticized for being reactive rather than proactive, and the lack of a clear long-term vision has led to some questionable purchases. In contrast, their rivals, such as Manchester City and Liverpool, have been more successful in their recruitment, making it difficult for United to keep pace at the top level. The club has also faced challenges off the pitch, with ownership issues and increasing fan discontent with the Glazer family's stewardship. Fans have long protested against the Glazers, citing their leveraged buyout of the club in 2005 and the lack of investment in infrastructure and player recruitment. This off-field unrest has, at times, overshadowed the team's performances, further complicating the club's quest for success."

        "words_200": "Daniel Craig has made a rare admission about one of the James Bond films he starred in. The actor played the British spy in the 007 franchise from 2006 film Casino Royale right through to No Time to Die in 2022. While the actor has bluntly made it clear he does not care about the future of the series, he has been looking back at his time playing the character, reflecting in particular on his second Bond outing Quantum of Solace. The Knives Out actor, who is being tipped for an Oscar nomination for his role in Luca Guadagnino's Queer, starred in the film during the 2007-2008 writers' strike that rocked many film and TV productions at the time. Craig described the sequel as a 'difficult second album' and said it was a 'nightmare' making the film as they were mostly without a script when cameras started rolling. 'We should never have started production,' he told The Hollywood Reporter, before sharing a revelation that he admitted he 'probably shouldn't say' - according to Craig, he ended up 'writing a lot of lines' for the film. While the film has been reappraised in recent years, with many taking into account its trouble production when assessing it, Craig does not class himself as one of its fans. He said: 'There are some amazing stunt sequences in it but it just didn't quite work. The storytelling wasn't there. That's a lesson - starting a movie without a script is not a good idea.' Craig injured himself three times while making Quantum of Solace, something he detailed in several follow-up interviews.",
        "words_above_300": "React Labs: What We've Been Working On - June 2022\nReact 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we've learned is that it's frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we're exploring. We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we'd like to start regularly sharing more about what we've been working on with the community across these projects. To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we're actively thinking about, and what we've learned so far. \n1. Asset Loading: Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more. We're looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.We're also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they're loaded but don't block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid “popcorning“ as the visuals pop and layout shifts.\n2. Static Server Rendering Optimizations: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) - especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We're exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.\n3. React Optimizing Compiler: We gave an early preview of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It's a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of useMemo and useCallback calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React's programming model. Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of local mutations, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks. We're also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does. It reveals various insights into how it works under the hood, and live renders the compiler's outputs as you type. "

To measure the factuality of language models, we are open-sourcing(opens in a new window) a new benchmark called SimpleQA. About the SimpleQA benchmark Factuality is a complicated topic because it is hard to measure—evaluating the factuality of any given arbitrary claim is challenging, and language models can generate long completions that contain dozens of factual claims. In SimpleQA, we will focus on short, fact-seeking queries, which reduces the scope of the benchmark but makes measuring factuality much more tractable. With SimpleQA, our goal was to create a dataset with the following properties: High correctness. Reference answers to questions are supported by sources from two independent AI trainers, and questions were written in such a way that the predicted answers are easy to grade. Diversity. SimpleQA covers a wide range of topics, from science and technology to TV shows and video games. Challenging for frontier models. Compared to older benchmarks such as TriviaQA(opens in a new window) (2017) or NQ(opens in a new window) (2019), which have become saturated, SimpleQA was created to be a greater challenge for frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o scores less than 40%). Good researcher UX. SimpleQA is intended to be fast and simple to run due to its concise questions and answers. Grading is also efficient whether through the OpenAI API or another frontier model API. Additionally, with 4,326 questions, SimpleQA should have relatively low variance as an evaluation benchmark. We hired AI trainers to browse the web and create short, fact-seeking questions and corresponding answers. To be included in the dataset, each question had to meet a strict set of criteria: it must have a single, indisputable answer for easy grading; the answer to the question should not change over time; and most questions had to induce hallucinations from either GPT-4o or GPT-3.5. To further improve the quality of the dataset, a second, independent AI trainer answered each question without seeing the original response. Only questions where both AI trainers' answers agreed were included. As a final verification of quality, we had a third AI trainer answer a random sample of 1,000 questions from the dataset. We found that the third AI trainer's answer matched the original agreed answers 94.4% of the time, with a 5.6% disagreement rate. We then manually inspected these examples, and found that 2.8% of the 5.6% of disagreements were due to grader false negatives or human errors from the third trainer (e.g., incomplete answers or misinterpreting sources), and the remaining 2.8% were due to real issues with the question (e.g., ambiguous questions, or different websites giving conflicting answers). Hence, we estimate the inherent error rate of this dataset to be approximately 3%.",

        "words_200": "Daniel Craig has made a rare admission about one of the James Bond films he starred in. The actor played the British spy in the 007 franchise from 2006 film Casino Royale right through to No Time to Die in 2022. While the actor has bluntly made it clear he does not care about the future of the series, he has been looking back at his time playing the character, reflecting in particular on his second Bond outing Quantum of Solace. The Knives Out actor, who is being tipped for an Oscar nomination for his role in Luca Guadagnino's Queer, starred in the film during the 2007-2008 writers' strike that rocked many film and TV productions at the time. Craig described the sequel as a 'difficult second album' and said it was a 'nightmare' making the film as they were mostly without a script when cameras started rolling. 'We should never have started production,' he told The Hollywood Reporter, before sharing a revelation that he admitted he 'probably shouldn't say' - according to Craig, he ended up 'writing a lot of lines' for the film. While the film has been reappraised in recent years, with many taking into account its trouble production when assessing it, Craig does not class himself as one of its fans. He said: 'There are some amazing stunt sequences in it but it just didn't quite work. The storytelling wasn't there. That's a lesson - starting a movie without a script is not a good idea.' Craig injured himself three times while making Quantum of Solace, something he detailed in several follow-up interviews.",
        "words_above_300": "React Labs: What We've Been Working On - June 2022\nReact 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we've learned is that it's frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we're exploring. We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we'd like to start regularly sharing more about what we've been working on with the community across these projects. To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we're actively thinking about, and what we've learned so far. \n1. Asset Loading: Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more. We're looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.We're also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they're loaded but don't block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid “popcorning“ as the visuals pop and layout shifts.\n2. Static Server Rendering Optimizations: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) - especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We're exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.\n3. React Optimizing Compiler: We gave an early preview of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It's a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of useMemo and useCallback calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React's programming model. Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of local mutations, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks. We're also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does. It reveals various insights into how it works under the hood, and live renders the compiler's outputs as you type. "
